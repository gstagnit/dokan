# >   * a root link table naming objects that lie past the recorded end-of-address
# >     -- the file and its link table read back fine and the damage surfaces only
# >     when an object header is actually accessed, as
# >     `KeyError: ... len not positive after adjustment for EOA`.
# >
# > Neither is detectable by a cheap up-front probe without a write open (which
# > would touch the file's mtime and so its `MergeObs` freshness identity), so both
