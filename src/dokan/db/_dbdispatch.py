"""Dokan job dispatcher task.

`DBDispatch` is responsible for two related actions:
1. Re-populate the queue with new production jobs when needed.
2. Select queued jobs, assign seeds, and hand them over to `DBRunner`.

The task can operate in two modes via `id`:
- `id == 0`: dynamic dispatch (global scheduling logic).
- `id > 0`: dispatch a specific job id.
